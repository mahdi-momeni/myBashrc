This is an open-source repository containing my personal `.zshrc` configuration. The `.bashrc` file is a script that is executed whenever you start a new interactive shell session. This configuration aims to enhance the terminal experience for web development and provide useful shortcuts, aliases, and functions.

## Prerequisites
Before using my Zsh configurations, ensure that you have Zsh installed on your system. You can install Zsh using your system's package manager or via other installation methods.

## Installation

```
 sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meiti-x/webdev-bashrc/main/prepare.sh)"

 source $HOME/.zshrc
 ```
This script will symlink the necessary configuration files and directories to your home directory ($HOME) and set up any additional packages or dependencies specified.

## Contents
- aliases/: Directory containing additional alias files organized by category for easy management.
- tools/: Directory containing installing tools that I use.
- functions/: Directory containing custom bash function that I have created or customized.

Feel free to customize any part of my Zsh configurations to suit your preferences. You can add or modify aliases, functions, or settings in the .zshrc file and organize them as you see fit.

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions, improvements, or feedback on my Zsh configurations, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Contributions are welcome!


Feel free to customize and expand upon this template to include any additional information or sections you think are relevant for your repository.

## Fun Fact

Did you know that despite the repository name being `webdev-bashrc`, it's actually focused on Zsh configurations? The name originates from my initial intention to write a `.bashrc` function for my web development projects. However, over time, I transitioned to using Zsh as my primary shell. While the name remains the same, the repository now houses my customized Zsh configurations, aliases, and packages.
